h3. CBA - Community Base Application

p{padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; background: #eee; border: 1px solid #888; font-size: 0.8em;}. _Note_: "Project's README":http://cba.iboard.cc/p/readme _should be_ identical to "README.textile on Github":http://github.com/iboard/CBA/blob/master/README.textile -- I try hard to keep both versions in synchronized state, but check out the Github-version too.  

*CBA* is forked from "Rails3-Mongoid-Devise by fortuity":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise, and extended by Andi Altendorfer with

* OmniAuth
* Paperclip
* CanCan
* jQuery
* autotest and spork

CBA's own implementations

h2. Installation

* See -> "Posting 'installation.rb'":http://cba.iboard.cc/blogs/4d456adae7798923b100000a/postings/4d53bb27e779893dd0000007


h2. Delayed Jobs

There is a rake-task to start the background jobs

<code>rake delayed_jobs:work</code>

Unfortunatley "DelayedJobs by 'tobi'":http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job doesn't work with MongoId.
So I did this my own way. To define new background-workers follow this steps:

# Define a worker in <code>app/workers</code> (See "new_sign_up_notifier.rb":http://github.com/iboard/CBA/tree/master/app/workers for example)
# Enqueue new Jobs like shown in <code>app/model/user.rb</code>, method <code>async_notify_on_creation</code> ("Source":https://gist.github.com/841907)

h2. Resource 'Page'

Since nearly any website needs some kind of 'semi-static pages' and we need some kind of object to test the application, there is a resource Page with the following features

# Consists of a title and a body
# The body is rendered with _RedCloth_
# The MongoId of <code>/page/MONGO_ID</code> in the browser-address will be replaced by <code>/p/title_of_the_page</code> with JS.

h2. Testing with spork

To run autotests you have to start the spork-server and then run autotest command

# <code>AUTOFEATURE=true bundle exec spork</code>
# <code>AUTOFEATURE=true bundle exec autotest</code>

To run your unit-tests using spork do

# <code>bundle exec spork TestUnit --port 8988</code>
# <code>testdrb -I test test/unit/*rb</code>
